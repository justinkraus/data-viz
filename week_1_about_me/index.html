    <p>I'm based out of Brooklyn and excited to be furthering a passion for data visualization through the MSc program here at Parsons.
        My personal projects focus on music discovery through anlysis of opinions and playlists. 
        These days I'm spending a lot of time rebuilding a php application for analyzing spotify playlists in python
        that I hope to enhance with visualizations through the skills learned in the program. 
        You can get a flavor for some of these things at personal portfolio <a href="http://justinkra.us">here.</a>

    Otherwise I'm a cyclist, reader, fan of old foreign movies (the Criterion Collection is great) or anything set in space. 
    Looking forward to working together and getting to know all of you!
